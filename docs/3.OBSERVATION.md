# Observation Types

## State-based

The default observation (`obs_buf`) is state-based, which includes the following:

- goal specification
- scaled joint position (`q`, |A|-dim)
- scaled joint velocity (`dq`, |A|-dim)
- last actions (`self.actions`, |A|-dim)
- scaled root angular velocity (`self.base_ang_vel * self.obs_scales.ang_vel`, 3-dim)
- scaled root euler angle (`self.base_euler_xyz * self.obs_scales.quat`, 3-dim)

If you want to change the observation structure (and obs/noise scales), make sure to override the corresponding functions in the subclass.

## Vision-based (for high-level tasks)

We also support vision-based observation. To use ego-centric color and depth for policy learning, set the following in config:

- `enable_sensor = True` to enable vision observations in the environment **and** enable vision input in the PPO training. You can also edit camera resolution, camera pose, etc.
- `policy_class_name = 'ActorCriticVision'` or `'ActorCriticHierarchicalVision'` for vision-based policies.
- `num_envs = 4` or other small numbers for training efficiency.
