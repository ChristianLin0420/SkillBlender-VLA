# Use Your Own Humanoid!

We support multiple humanoid robots (H1, G1, H1-2) for our benchmark. And it's easy to add your own humanoid, by following the steps below:

1. Add your humanoid assets to `resources/robots`.

2. In `legged_gym/legged_gym/envs`, create a new folder for your humanoid. In this folder, create a subfolder for a specific skill or task, e.g. `legged_gym/legged_gym/envs/h1_2/h1_2_something`.

3. In this task folder, create 2 new files: config file and environment file, e.g. `h1_2_something_config.py` and `h1_2_something.py`. You can copy-paste from existing humanoid files.

4. If the 2 files are copy-pasted, you need to modify them. 

    1. Change all the names of both files to your humanoid name, e.g. `h1 -> h1_2`. This includes class names and the default experiment name.
    2. Search for the original humanoid name and resolve all the import errors based on the changed names.
    3. For config file, search for the **9** `NOTE` in `g1_stepping_config.py` to see what you need to modify.
    4. For environment file, typically you only need to modify the joint indices of reward functions (e.g. `_reward_upper_body_pos, _reward_default_joint_pos, _reward_right_arm_default`).

5. Register your environment in `legged_gym/legged_gym/envs/__init__.py`.
